## New to OpenEnv? Start Here

The Getting Started Series walks you from zero to deploying your own environment in five short parts. No GPU required.

| Part | What it covers |
|------|---------------|
| [1 — Introduction & Quick Start](../auto_getting_started/plot_01_introduction_quickstart) | What OpenEnv is, why it exists, and your first environment in under 10 minutes |
| [2 — Using Environments](../auto_getting_started/plot_02_using_environments) | Connect to environments, create policies, run evaluations |
| [3 — Building Environments](../auto_getting_started/plot_03_building_environments) | Create a custom environment from scratch |
| [4 — Packaging & Deploying](../auto_getting_started/environment-builder) | Package with Docker and deploy to Hugging Face |
| [5 — Contributing to Hugging Face](../auto_getting_started/contributing-envs) | Publish, fork, and share environments on the Hub |
