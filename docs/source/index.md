## What is OpenEnv?

**OpenEnv** is an end-to-end framework designed to standardize how agents interact with execution environments during reinforcement learning (RL) training. At its core, OpenEnv provides a consistent, Gymnasium-compatible interface through three simple APIs: `step()`, `reset()`, and `state()`.

### Why OpenEnv?

Training RL agents—especially in agentic settings like code generation, web browsing, or game playing—requires environments that are:

- **Isolated**: Each agent instance runs in its own sandboxed environment, preventing interference and ensuring reproducibility.
- **Scalable**: Environments can be deployed as HTTP services or containerized with Docker, enabling distributed training across clusters.
- **Standardized**: A unified API means researchers and practitioners can switch between environments without rewriting integration code.

OpenEnv bridges the gap between environment creators and RL practitioners:

- **For Researchers & Framework Authors**: Interact with any OpenEnv-compatible environment using familiar Gymnasium-style APIs—no need to learn environment-specific protocols.
- **For Environment Creators**: Build rich, production-ready environments with built-in support for HTTP deployment, Docker packaging, and security isolation.

## Getting Started

New to OpenEnv? Follow our recommended learning path:

1. **[Getting Started Series](tutorials/index)** — A 5-part series covering what OpenEnv is, how to use and build environments, and how to contribute. No GPU required.

2. **[Build Your Own Environment](auto_getting_started/environment-builder)** — The complete reference guide for creating, packaging, and deploying custom environments with Docker and Hugging Face Hub.

3. **[Simulation vs Production Mode](guides/simulation-vs-production)** — Understand when to use the training loop, when to expose MCP directly, and how tools behave in each mode.

4. **[MCP Environment Lifecycle](guides/mcp-environment-lifecycle)** — Understand how MCP tools fit into the OpenEnv step loop, when `step_async()` is used, and when to use `call_tool()` versus `step(...)`.

5. **[Explore Environments](environments)** — Browse pre-built environments for games, coding, web browsing, and more.

## How Can I Contribute?

We welcome contributions from the community! If you find a bug, have a feature request, or want to contribute a new environment, please open an issue or submit a pull request. The repository is hosted on GitHub at [meta-pytorch/OpenEnv](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/OpenEnv).

```{warning}
OpenEnv is currently in an experimental stage. You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and APIs that may change in future versions. The project welcomes bug fixes, but to ensure coordination, please discuss significant changes before starting work. Signal your intention to contribute in the issue tracker by filing a new issue or claiming an existing one.
