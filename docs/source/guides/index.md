## Using Environments

- [**Auto-Discovery (AutoEnv)**](auto-discovery.md) - Automatically discover and load environments
- [**Connecting to Servers**](connecting.md) - Connect via HTTP, Docker, or Hugging Face Spaces
- [**Async vs Sync Usage**](async-sync.md) - When and how to use async vs sync clients

## Building Environments

- [**Your First Environment**](first-environment.md) - Build a simple environment from scratch
- [**Environment Anatomy**](environment-anatomy.md) - Deep dive into environment structure
- [**Deployment**](deployment.md) - Deploy to Docker, Hugging Face Spaces, and registries
- [**Customizing the Web UI**](customizing-web-ui.md) - Customize your environment's built-in web interface

## Training

- [**RL Framework Integration**](rl-integration.md) - Use OpenEnv with TRL, torchforge, and more
- [**Reward Design**](rewards.md) - Design effective reward functions for your agents
- [**Simulation vs Production Mode**](simulation-vs-production.md) - When to use the training loop vs direct MCP access
- [**MCP Environment Lifecycle**](mcp-environment-lifecycle.md) - How MCP tools fit into the step loop
